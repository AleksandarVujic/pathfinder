Pathfinder is small travel blog application, created for demonstrating tools and techniques which are boosting performance and enhancing UX within Angular applications. This application is used as demo app for company internal conference event.

Pathfinder leverages the power of Server Side Rendering (SSR) coupled with non-destructive hydration, seamlessly blending server-generated content with client-side interactivity. This sophisticated approach ensures lightning-fast initial page loads, providing users with a swift and engaging experience right from the get-go.

Pathfinder showcases Angular's directive NgOptimizedImage, a powerful tool optimizing image loading and rendering for improved performance. This not only enhances the visual appeal of the travel blog but also contributes to a smoother overall browsing experience.
